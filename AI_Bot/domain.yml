           All study courses in this institute are fully residential and students are required to stay throughout their program except vacations.

           Academics in IIITM began with PGDMIT (Post Graduate Diploma in Management and Information Technology) in 1998, followed by PGDIT (Post Graduate Diploma in Information Technology) in 1999, and Ph. D. in 2000.
           Our 5-year IPG (Integrated Post Graduate) program was also initiated in 2000.

           This institute offers doctoral degrees in various fields of IT and management. 
           Apart from these regular study courses, the institute conducts MDP (Management Development Programs) for outsiders from time to time.

           Its location at the foothills of Gwalior fort is idyllic for an institute of this stature. 
           Though it is not far from city centre it has a tranquil ambiance as desired of an academic institute. 
           With nearly four-fifths of the institute covered with greenery, the environment is pristine and tranquil.
           Together with academics it offers an ideal surrounding for extra-curricular activities.

           The institute is easily accessible by road, and there are cabs and auto-rickshaws to commute from railway station or airport.
           Shopping centres and market places are located nearby and about ten minutes driving distance away."
